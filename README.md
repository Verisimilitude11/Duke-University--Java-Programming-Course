# Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software
Through this course, I learned about how to:
1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
2. Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs. 
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
8. Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.

At the end of the course, I wrote an algorithm that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files.
