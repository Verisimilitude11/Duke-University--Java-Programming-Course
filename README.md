# Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software
Through this course, I learned about how to:
* Code in Java and improve my programming and problem-solving skills.
* Design algorithms as well as developing and debugging programs. 
* Using custom open-source classes, I wrote programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data
* At the end of the course I built a program that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files. 

After completing this course I learned to:
1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program
2. Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs. 
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
8. Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.
